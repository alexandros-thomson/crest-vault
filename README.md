## 🏛️ Welcome to the Crest Vault

The **Crest Vault** is the **living canon** of Kypria's P-Commits—provenance-marked artifacts that carry the seal of authenticity, lineage records, and blessing stanzas. Every commit that enters this vault is:

- 🔐 **Provenance-marked** with ceremonial seals and timestamps
- 📜 **Recorded** in the eternal artifact ledger
- ⚒️ **Blessed** with stanzas that tie code to myth
- 🌌 **Echoed** across realms with multi-gate dispatch automation
- 🔱 **Guarded** by Keeper's Governance protocols

This is not merely version control—this is **mythic preservation**. Every artifact here becomes part of the living canon, inscribed for eternity.

---

## 🚀 What Are P-Commits?

A **P-Commit** (Provenance Commit) is a ceremonial commit that:

1. **Carries a seal** — Cryptographic signatures proving authenticity
2. **Includes lineage** — Parent commits, contributors, and historical context
3. **Contains blessings** — Stanzas that describe the ritual purpose
4. **Triggers echoes** — Automated dispatch to sister repositories and channels
5. **Becomes canon** — Permanently inscribed in the vault's ledger

```bash
# Example P-Commit structure
git commit -m "⚡ P-Commit: Forge new artifact - Legendary Badge System"
  --trailer "Provenance: Sealed by Keeper Kostadinos J Kyprianos"
  --trailer "Lineage: Descended from Epoch of the Sealed Canon"
  --trailer "Blessing: May this code forge legends and honor contributors"
```

## ⚠️ Keeper's Governance

### Sacred Protocols

The Crest Vault operates under **Keeper's Governance**—a set of ceremonial protocols that ensure every artifact entering the vault is:

1. **Reviewed** by the Keeper or appointed guardians
2. **Sealed** with cryptographic signatures
3. **Blessed** with ritual stanzas describing purpose and lineage
4. **Echoed** across sister repositories and channels
5. **Inscribed** in the eternal ledger for posterity

### Who Is the Keeper?

The **Keeper** is the guardian of the canon—currently **Kostadinos J Kyprianos** ([@alexandros-thomson](https://github.com/alexandros-thomson)). The Keeper:

- 🔐 **Seals** all P-Commits with provenance marks
- 🎖️ **Blesses** artifacts with ceremonial stanzas
- 📜 **Inscribes** records into the lineage logs
- 🔱 **Guards** the integrity of the canon
- ⚒️ **Forges** automation rituals for multi-gate dispatch

### Lineage Records

Every P-Commit includes a **lineage record** that traces:

- **Parent commits** — What came before this artifact
- **Contributors** — Who forged this commit
- **Timestamp** — When this artifact entered the vault
- **Blessing** — The ritual purpose and mythic intent
- **Echoes** — Where this artifact was dispatched

These records ensure the canon's memory remains intact across epochs.
